        <h1>Structural Tags</h1>
        <p>Structural Tags (HEADER, NAV, MAIN, FOOTER).</p>

        <p>What goes in the header? We can put a logo, the title of the page, search bars and even the naviation menu. </p>

        <p>What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain links to another website?
        We can put links in the Navigation. The Navigation can go in the Header, I could also go below the header. No, we want to send it to pages that go withing our web page.</p>

        <p>What goes in Main? All the unique content of that page. (the main thing that this web page is about).</p>

        <p>What goes in the Footer? It goes at the bottom of the Page, and we can put links to social media, legal prints (copyright, privacy notice, Cooke preferences, etc), links to other resources, and contact infromation.. </p>

        <p>HTML Validation: It helps us to check if our code is correct and helps us avoid errors and gives us warnings.</p>
