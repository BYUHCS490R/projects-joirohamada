<p>What goes in the header? </p>

<p>What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain links to another website?
    We can put links in the Navigation. The Navigation can go in the Header, I could also go below the header. No, we want to send it to pages that go withing our web page.
