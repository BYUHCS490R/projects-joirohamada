        <p>List out the different ways to select an item.
        <p>1. Tag Name (p, h1, header, body, html</p>
        <p>2. Descendent Rule.</p>
        <p>3. ID (It has to start with a letter and NO SPACES!!).and in order to select it, we use the 
        # symbol.</p>
        <p>4. Class start with a period . letters or symbols (NO SPACES!!!).</p>
        <br>
        <p>What is the difference between an ID and a Class? ID starts with a hashtag # and class starts with a period . You can use the same name for class in order to use the same function. You can also add multiple classes in the same section</p>   
        <p>What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag? A div tag group things together in order to separate specific parts to the rest of the HTML.
        SPAN tag helps us to change a specific line in a Paragraph, but works the same.
        </p>
        <p>What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER? DIV is a generic container with no meaning. Header, MAIN, and FOOTER are tags that explain to the page what function each part of our page serves for.</p>
        <p>What are the different ways to select a color?
            1. Name
            2. RGB (red green, blue) (from 0 to 255)
            3. Hex Code. (#9595)
            4. Short Hex Code. (#FFF)
