    <h2>Internet</h2>
    <p>The internet is a global network of computer networks that allows us to communicate information. It is literally physically connected through underwater cables around the planet.</p>
    <h2>Web</h2>
    <p>Known as the World Wide Web, it is a service of web pages and information that run within the internet.</p>
    <h2>How are the Internet and Web different?</h2>
    <p>The internet is the infrastructure that connects everything
     (like a highway). The web, on the other hand, is like the cars that travel on that highway (what you can actually see).</p>
    <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
    <p>ASCII is a dictionary that translates the numbers that the computer can process into an alphabet that is readable for us.
    And Unicode is the comprehensive dictionary readable by all the languages ​​of the world (ASCII only has 128 characters for the English language, while Unicode has many more).
    </p>
    <h2>What is UTF-8</h2>
    <p>It is a system of characters just like Unicode, but unlike other sistems, It uses diferent amount of bytes and shearable with diferent countries of the world.</p>
    <h2>URL</h2>
    <p>Uniform Resource Locator. The URL is the address through which the information passes. </p>
    <h2>Domain Name</h2>

    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>Stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, and and it is the set of rules that allows us to exchange information between our browser and our server.</p>

    <h2>IP Address</h2>
    <p>IP stands for Internet protocol, and it is the numerical label that allows us to identify our website or our devices.</p>
    <h2>DNS</h2>

    <h2>W3C Recommendations</h2>
    <p>OThese are the official standards of the World Wide Web Consortium that tell us how web technologies should work.</p>
    <h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
    <p>XML: (eXtensible Markup Language) It is a language that structures and transmits data. This allows us to help store data in an organized manner.
        <p>XHTML: (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language). It is a stricter version of XML for cleaning and structuring our data. </p>
        <p>HTML: (HyperText Markup Language). It is the basic language of the web and creates the structure of web pages. </p>
