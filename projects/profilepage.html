    <h1>Hello! Hola! こんにちは！ My name is Joiro Hamada &amp; I want to get to know you better!</h1>
    <p>初めまして！Mucho gusto! I am <mark>Joiro Hamada</mark>. I was born in Springfield, Ohio, USA, 22 years ago. I was born on July 18, 2003. I am half Japanese/Mexican. My dad is from Osaka, Japan, and my mom is from Chiapas, Mexico.
    <br>
    <br>
    When I was 2 years and a half years old, I moved to Osaka for a year, and then I moved to Chiapas in Mexico where I lived for 6 years. After living there for 6 years, because of my dad's job, we had to move to Baja California in northern Mexico where I lived for 3 years. After that I moved to Jalisco for another 6 years. After graduating from high school, I moved with my dad to Saitama, Japan, where I learned Japanese.
    Then I decided to go on a mission. I was assigned to serve in the Nagoya Japan Mission. 2 years later, I decided to move to Hawaii to get a degree in Computer Science here at BYUH where I am currently studying.
    </p>
    <p>My hobbies are to listen and play music. I play the <em>violin</em>, <em>guitar</em> and <em>piano</em>, and I am currently the pianist for the Salsa Orchestra here at BYUH. I also like dancing to salsa, cumbia and bachata. I <strong>LOVEE</strong> to travel and to get to know new places. I am planning on going to Europe for the first time for spring break and I am very excited about it!</p>
