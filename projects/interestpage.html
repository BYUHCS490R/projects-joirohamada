        <h2 id="subtitle">Listening to Music!</h2>
        <h3>Arctic Monkeys</h3>
            <p>Since I was a child, I've always been a fan of listening to music, but one of the bands that has had the most influence on my life is <span> class="emphasize">Arctic Monkeys</span>. I consider this band my favorite band. </p>
            <p>When I was in high school, I hung out with some college students in my free time, and we used to practice songs like "A Certain Romance," "When the Sun Goes Down," "Fluorescent Adolescent," etc.  My all-time favorite album is definitely <span> class="emphasize">WPSIATWIN</span>.</p>

            <h2>Traveling!</h2>
        <h3>Places I visited</h3>
            <p>I don't consider myself someone who has visited many countries, however, I have had the opportunity to travel throughout my own country. From Tijuana in northern Mexico, we traveled by car all the way to southeastern Mexico, to Cancun.
            I have also had the opportunity to visit certain parts of Japan, such as Osaka, Kyoto, Nachi Falls, Kanazawa, Nagoya, Tokyo, Kusatsu Onsen, and even Aomori in the northern part of Japan's main island.</p>
            <p>I have visited some places in the United States, such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, Texas, Ohio, Michigan, and New York.</p>
            <p>I have also visited Canada, Guatemala and Belize.</p>
            <h3>Places I would love to visit</h3>
            <p>These upcoming holidays will be my first trip abroad as a university student, and one of my dreams has always been to visit Europe. Italy is one of the countries I've wanted to visit the most throughout my life, as well as France and Spain.</p>
            <p>At some point, I would also love to finish traveling through Latin America, visiting countries like Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Puerto Rico, Cuba, etc.</p>
            <p><span class="emphasize">But the country that definitely earns the number one spot is China.</span> I don't consider China a normal country. China has a larger population than the entire European continent and a vast variety of cultures. It has one of the most famous of the seven wonders of the modern world, and I would love to travel there.</p>

        <h2>About links!</h2>
        <h3>Absolute link</h3>
            <p>An absolute link is a URL that provides information about a webpage. It starts with HTTPS (the protocol), the website name (subdomain), and the path (which is the directory or the specific page).</p>
        <h4 class="example">Example:</h4>
            <p>This is a link to my personal LinkedIn:</p>
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joiro-hamada/">LinkedIn</a> 

            <h3>Relative link</h3>
            <p>A relative link is a URL that takes us to another location within the page we are already on. This saves time because we don't have to enter the entire link, including the subdomain, since we are using the same subdomain.</p>
        <h4 class="example">Example:</h4>
            <p>This is a link to my previous webpage I created (My profile):</p>
            <a href="profilepage.html">My profile page</a>
