        <p>
        I would like to tell you a little bit about what kind of person my Alex Turner is.
        </p>
        <p>Alex Turner is the main vocalist from <span class="emphasize">Arctic Monkeys</span>. He is originally from Sheffield, England and he loves The Strokes. He is a huge fan of Julian Casablancas. He started playing music because his father was also a music teacher.</p>
        <p>He started his band when, one Christmas, his parents gave him his first guitar at the age of 17, a white Mexican <span class="emphasize">Fender Stratocaster</span>, and since then he and his high school friends have been writing songs together, creating one of my favorite albums.
